# OpenFlame Framework

## changelog

 - 1.0.0 **initial** release
	 - First public release
 - 1.1.0 **minor** release
	 - Altered the `URL\Builder` component so that GET params can be added to all generated URLs (ticket #54)
	 - Document and cleanup the code for the `Security\Seeder` component (ticket #41)
	 - Overhauled the asset instance and asset manager objects for supporting assets on an external domain (ticket #53)
	 - Optimize the event dispatcher for use with closures, functions, and static method calls
	 - Rework TTL support for the caching system and how file-based caching engines are designed (ticket #50)
		- NOTE: This change breaks backwards compatibility when instantiating the caching engines
	 - Introduce a new object (`Security\Form`) that provides form key creation and validation (ticket #20)
 - 1.1.1 **maintenance** release
	 - Fix minor bug with grabbing the commit ID from within the framework phar
 - 1.1.2 **maintenance** release
	 - Fix bug with `Security\Seeder` component - all randomly generated strings will be returned of the requested length now
 - 1.1.3 **maintenance** release
	 - Fix bug with cache component - removed an old unneeded method from the engine interface
 - 1.2.0 **minor** release
	 - Add in new dependency injection component `Dependency\Injector` (ticket #57)
	 - Refactored the cookie management code and split it out into its own component (ticket #55).
	 - Made microoptimizations in component `Event\Dispatcher`
	 - Added new method `triggerUntilReturn()` in component `Event\Dispatcher` (see commit id `d88453eaec` for details)
	 - Refactor RouteInstance callback storage, simplify callback execution and remove ability to "call" methods of objects stored in the OpenFlame Framework core
	 - Pass the `$request_url` parameter in method `processRequest()` the component `Router\Router` by reference to allow the end application to obtain the sanitized form without resanitizing it
	 - Remove `OpenFlame\ROOT_PATH` constant check in every class file
	 - Refactor the autoloader to not use the now-defunct `OpenFlame\ROOT_PATH` constant for autoloading; it must now be passed the autoload path upon instantiation
	 - Add new component object `Router\AliasRouter` to expand upon current dynamic routing capabilities
	 - Modify the `Router\RouteInstance` component object to add new route "aliases", which are resolved against the new component `Router\AliasRouter` for a usable callback
	 - Refactor the cache component again internally, altered the interface and the file-cache engine base to remove the need for the "build" method  in all cache engines (makes an opcache-based engine much more viable)
	 - Fix a bug in the `URL\BuilderProxy` class, which caused problems when the site root directory was used as the base URL (commit id `090993b42d`)
	 - Convert the autoloader into a singleton class
	 - Remove "magic" return functionality from `Event\Instance` component -- method `getReturns()` in `Event\Instance` will now always return an array
	 - Remove `countReturns()` method from `Event\Instance` component, due to the changes in `getReturns()`
	 - Protect ourselves from sentient code, added `CAN_BECOME_SKYNET` and `COST_TO_BECOME_SKYNET` class constants to the framework Core
	 - Deprecated `dataPointExists()`, `getDataPoint()`, `setDataPoint()` in `Event\Instance` (use `exists()`, `get()`, `set()` respectively instead)
	 - Deprecated `getRequestDataPoint()`, `setRequestDataPoint()` in `Router\RouteInstance` (use `get()`, `set()` respectively instead)
	 - No longer throwing an exception on empty JSON files (which received NULL from `json_decode()` internally) in `Utility\JSON`
	 - Change behavior of `__get()` method of `Header\Manager` to match that of `getSubmodule()`
	 - Add new object `Event\Scheduler` for scheduling events to be triggered at regular intervals
	 - Deprecated `triggerUntilReturn()` and `triggerUntilBreak()` in `Event\Dispatcher` (use method `trigger` and supply the second param with the `TRIGGER_NOBREAK`, `TRIGGER_MANUALBREAK`, `TRIGGER_RETURNBREAK` class constants instead)
	 - Added method alias `triggerBreak()` (aliases to `breakTrigger()`) to `Event\Instance` to make it more intuitive
	 - Added GC method to cache engine, drivers to allow file-based cache engines to clean up old entries
	 - Added support for multiple twig loaders via `Twig_Loader_Chain` in `Twig\Wrapper`
 - 1.2.1 **maintenance** release
	 - Fix problem with `Event\Dispatcher` component when using object methods as listeners
	 - Drop nullified listeners from `Event\Dispatcher` component when triggering an event, in case they are objects nulled by reference down the road
 - 1.2.2 **maintenance** release
	 - Provide support for "duplicators" in `Dependency\Injector` component by returning a closure within an injector.
	 - Fix `Utility\JSON` parsing when the `#` character is used for things other than line comments.
	 - Add new functionality in `Event\Dispatcher` component to allow listeners to be designated as "timed", and have them automatically removed after being called a specified number of times.
 - 1.3.0 **minor** release
	 - Refactor `Exception\Handler` internally for easier configuration
	 - Add ability to disable code-context obtainment in `Exception\Handler` (useful when using packed phars for storing PHP code)
	 - Refactor `Utility\JSON` parsing again to actually fix the use of `#` character when decoding JSON strings.  Yes, it's really fixed this time.
	 - Add new component `Exception\EncryptedHandler` which can use OpenSSL keys to encrypt exception data when not in debug mode, to provide full debug data without the risk of information exposure.
	 - Add new component `Exception\EncryptHelper` which helps generate OpenSSL keys and decrypt exception data provided by the component `Exception\EncryptedHandler`.
	 - Removed previously deprecated methods  `dataPointExists()`, `getDataPoint()`, `setDataPoint()` in `Event\Instance`, `getRequestDataPoint()`, `setRequestDataPoint()` in `Router\RouteInstance`, `triggerUntilReturn()` and `triggerUntilBreak()` in `Event\Dispatcher`.
 - 1.3.1 **maintenance** release
	 - Fix notice thrown in `Event\Scheduler`.
	 - Fix exception message used in `Twig\Wrapper` to provide the actual path used when looking for the Twig autoloader.
	 - Minor optimization in `Security\Seeder`
 - 1.3.2 **maintenance** release
	 - Fix bug with `Event\Scheduler` calling previously deprecated and now removed `Event\Dispatcher` method
	 - Fix bug with undefined variable notices in `Event\Scheduler`

	 - Added `ACL\Auth` and `ACL\Translator` components for handling permissions checks, group permissions and permission inheritance
 - 2.0.0 **major** release
	 - Refactored Autoloader internally for speed enhancements
	 - Moved `Core` object and `Autoloader` object to new `Core\` namespace
	 - Added core exceptions, from which all components will use
	 - Created child classes of SPL exceptions in core exceptions, which implement the interface `Core\OpenFlameException` allowing all openflame-framework-specific exceptions to be caught independently of SPL exceptions

	 - Removed "config namespacing" functionality from `Core\Core`
	 - Moved `Dependency\Injector` component to `Core\` namespace,
	 - Refactored `Core\DependencyInjector` so that it will automatically generate instances of an object, given the name of the class to load (for easy lazy-loading)
	 - Refactored `Event\Dispatcher`, added new break type `Event\Dispatcher::TRIGGER_MIXEDBREAK` which combines the functionality of `Event\Dispatcher::TRIGGER_RETURNBREAK` and `Event\Dispatcher::TRIGGER_MANUALBREAK`
	 - Refactored `Utility\JSON` to add `json_encode()` error detection
	 - Dissolved `Security\` namespace
	 - Moved `Security\Form` to `Utility\FormKey`
	 - Moved `Security\Hasher` to `Utility\Hasher`
	 - Moved `Security\Seeder` to `Utility\Seeder`
